# rpcFramework

A lightweight RPC Framework

This will be an RPC Framework which implements Java NIO and AIO to acheive the following things:

1. Low Level Network Protocol including Java NIO, AIO, OIO 

2. Netty support for better network performance

3. Distributed client and server which support Zookeeper and YARN for cluster management

4. High Level RPC support to enable generic functions for easy implementations

5. Intermediate proxy to support subscriber pattern.
